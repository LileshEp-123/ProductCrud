I have created the CRUD Application using SpringBoot and Hibernate in which i have created an Entity as Product to perform CRUD operations through RESTFul API's....with this i have also managed to handle the errors(Exception Handling),also use the MYSQL for Storing the data,along with this i implemented the input validations like :Name should not be Empty,Price Should be Positive etc..
